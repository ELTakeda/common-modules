# TAKEDA ALCHEMER MODULE  
The purpose of the module is for agencies and content feeders to be able to provide surveys to HCPs on the websites they access. A tagging system is implemented as part of the whole module, which provides the option to track users' activity on a Business unit. Tags should be editable by website developers, but the functionality to add tags to resources within the website should be available and configurable. Tags should be configured for therapy areas (part of a website that can be accessed from the parent website), resources, products, items, articles, materials, etc.

The module also provides the possibility to include a microfeedback survey, which leverages a thumbs-up/thumbs-down feedback mechanism. The purpose of this is for Marketers to get insight into the appropriateness and suitability of content for further improvements.

## FOR SITE ADMINISTRATORS  
The Site Administrator can install this module and do the following:
 1. From first configuration form (Alchemer basic settings)

 2. From second configuration form (Alchemer popup tags settings):
 - Add multiple groups. Each group contains 5 text plain fields for therapy areas and products and a dropdown list containing pages on which we can apply these tags to. A single page can participate in only one group, so the maximum number of groups that can be added is limited.
 - Remove created groups

 3. From third configuration form (Alchemer microfeedback settings)
 - Add multiple groups. Each group contains 3 text plain fields for therapy areas and products and a dropdown list containing pages on which we can apply these tags to. A single page can participate in only one group, so the maximum number of groups that can be added is limited.
 - Remove created groups
